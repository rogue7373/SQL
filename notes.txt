Analysis - develops an entity-relationship model, capturing data requirements while ignoring implementation details.
    1. Discover entities, relationships, and attributes
    2. Determine cardinality
    3. Distinguish indpendent entities
    4. Create supertype and subtype entities
Logical Design - Converts the entity-relationship model into tables, columns, and keys for a particular database system.
    5. Implement entities
    6. IMplement relationships
    7. Implement attributes 
    8. Normalize tables 
Physical Design - adds indexes and specifies how tables are organized on storage media

Why -- Analysis is important for complex databases with many users when documenting requirements is challenging.
